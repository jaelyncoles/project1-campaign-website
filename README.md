candidate:
the candidate I chose was Penguin. 
he lives in Gotham which is overrun by criminals and maniacs. he sees the Gotham police department as useless and believes he would do a much better job restoring "peace" to the city.  He is running for constable to return structre to the city as well as find a way out of the city. for a price.

Stories:

criminal carl- is a petty criminal that lives in Gotham. Robs and steals to survive, and sometimes for fun. he is often running into bigger crime bosses who threaten him for operating in their territory. 

    Carl is poor in gotham so he doesnt have access to the internet for long. the site needs to be simple and to the point.0

    as a criminal i can go to the page to register for the criminal license

    He is looking for a candidate to not eliminate crime, but also protect him from the big bosses. 2 

    carl is a criminal so he would like the option to remain anonymmous on the site. 

    he never really learned to read so he needs simple wording 1


 Civillian sally - is a completely innocent citizen in Gotham. She wanted a way out but has been trapped there since the bridges were blown up

    as a civillion I can sign up for updates on the site
    
    she is looking for a site where she can keep up with updates 3

    she needs a site where she can get in touch with the candidate to ask for help 3

High Class Harry is an elite member of Gotham. he has been stuck in the house to avoid being killed for his money and resources.  he has pleanty of time to kill and likes nice things.

    he's stuck in the house so he has time to look through the site and see what the candidate is about 
    
    he is rich and he's impressed with nice things so he wants an extravagent site

    he doesnt really care about the city he's in his own world, he needs a reason to want to visit the site.  3
